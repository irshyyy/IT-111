                <h3>QUALITY EDUCATION (SDG4)</h3>
                <p>The SDG4, also known as Quality Education, ensures inclusive and 
                    equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all.
                     It aims to provide a high-quality education, including critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity,
                     and collaboration skills that students can use in the future.
                      This goal ensures that despite gender, socioeconomic background, disability,
                       or other factors, everyone should have equal access to quality education. 
                    As a college student aiming to become a successful woman someday, 
                    I believe that education is an important tool in making dreams; 
                    it is a way to become successful in the future. 
                    It helps students to acquire skills and knowledge needed in the future, 
                    and it encourages individuals to communicate with others, sharing their opinions, and build a good relationship.</p>
